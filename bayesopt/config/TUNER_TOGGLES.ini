# TUNER CONTROL - THREE MAIN TOGGLES
# ============================================================
# This file controls the THREE main tuner settings
# NO DIGGING IN CODE REQUIRED - just edit these values
# ============================================================

[main_controls]
# Toggle 1: Turn the entire tuner on or off
# True = Tuner runs automatically in background
# False = Tuner is completely disabled
tuner_enabled = False

# Toggle 2: Block shooting until shot is logged (hit or miss button pressed)
# True = Robot cannot shoot again until driver logs previous shot result
# False = Robot can shoot freely (may miss logging some shots)
# RECOMMENDED: False for normal play, True for intensive tuning sessions
require_shot_logged = False

# Toggle 3: Block shooting until tuner finishes calculations and updates coefficients
# True = Robot waits for optimizer before allowing next shot
# False = Shooting and optimization happen independently
# RECOMMENDED: False for normal play, True for sequential testing
require_coefficients_updated = False

# Team Configuration

[team]
# Your FRC team number (used to calculate robot IP address)
team_number = 5892

# ============================================================
# THAT'S IT!

# These are the only settings you need to change regularly.
